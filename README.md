# playlistrs
Extracts playlist data from iTunes®/Music Libraries. Tested against iTunes

## Note About Catalina and later:

Starting in MacOS Catalina, iTunes® has been replaced with the new Music app. While the new Music app includes the ability to export to m3u or m3u8, but if like me you have 50+ playlists it's a little inconvenient. You can automate the exporting with Automator but I prefer to just use this tool which can also change the path for other devices.
